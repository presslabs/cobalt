# Architecture

### Possibilities
- API-engine & agent architecture
- API, engine & agent architecture

### Objective
Both architecture ideas will be presented with respect to separation of concerns, decoupling along with the pros and cons in order to conclude to the choice we have made here.

---

### API-engine & agent architecture

This architecture assigns the API-engine nodes two main roles:

- Processing client requests (API)
- Making decisions regarding who should do the requested jobs (Engine)

##### Processing client requests
The client (be it a web application, or a cli) will send BTRFS volume requests towards the API-engine nodes. Each of them will compete for acquiring the lease for being master. The master node at that given moment will process the request and prepare it for getting assigned to a storage box. This way we can avoid multiple nodes processing the same request.

##### Decision making
After the request has been processed, the engine will check which storage box would be ideal for doing the work. Criteria for making this decision could be optimal criteria (free space available, task queue size) and required criteria (node availability). This information will all be available for both API-engine nodes and storage box nodes in the etcd cluster. The engine will then delegate the job to a storage box by writing it inside the etcd cluster.

---

The storage boxes will share their state with the etcd cluster through heartbeats performed by the agent. When the agent sees that its current state is different from the state found in etcd, it will check for the difference (which will consist of the new volume request) and place the new job as a task in its queue.

#### Pros
- The only role of the API is to process requests. It has no need to communicate with an external service (etcd)
- Decision making relies exclusively on the engine, which conceptually is correct
- The storage boxes have only one responsibility beside data storage, that being volume management itself, which is the main purpose of Cobalt
- Storage node downtime does not imply inaccessibility to the API. Requests can still be made and will be resolved later

#### Cons
- Increased number of nodes
- If none of the storage box agents can schedule new pending requests, the risk of an infinite loop occurs and none of the API-engine nodes can return an error response to the client

---

### API, engine & agent architecture
This architecture has all three components residing on each storage box. All three need to communicate with the etcd cluster in order to fulfill their job.

#### API
The API component is once again responsible for receiving client requests and placing them in the etcd cluster.

#### Engine
The engine component will compete for acquiring the master lease and will delegate jobs for itself and for the other nodes as well by comparing their current states with the desired states on the etcd cluster. Like in the previous architecture schema, only one engine can be master at any point in time and only that node will make decisions for the whole cluster.

#### Agent
The agent will share its node's state to etcd and notice differences when new jobs are placed there. It will then try to bring the node from its current state (e.g. `n` created volumes) to the desired state (e.g. `n+1` created volumes) by accomplishing the jobs assigned to it.

#### Pros
- The etcd cluster is internal to the storage box cluster. There is no need for any other node types to communicate with it
- One less layer of complexity: if a problem occurs, the entire logic resides in one place. Network connectivity issues are less likely to be the problem.

#### Cons
- Full failure: if the node is down for some reason, none of its components will do their job. Unlike in the first architecture implementation, this one does not permit sending requests to be processed by the API and scheduled later, when the storage node is restored to a functional state

---

### Conclusions
While the first proposed architecture puts less work on the storage nodes, the second one promotes simplicity by getting rid of extra layers of communication while keeping the components decoupled and their roles consistent.
Our choice was to go with the API, engine & agent architecture.
